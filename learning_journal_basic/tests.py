Several of their ideas seem like very good ones. I wish I could help out with all of them. Alas, decisions must be made, and we will eventually come to each work on one of a handful of projects. Such is life. We must choose decisively, and live with our choices for the rest of our days.</p><p>Avery and Patrick had awesome presentations. I learned about Itertools from Patrick, and can't wait for the chance to practice. Avery presented on an enhancement for Visual Studio that allows you to see documentation for functions as you are writing them. How cool is that!</p>" in str(response)
